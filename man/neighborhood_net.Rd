\arguments{
\item{data}{Optional raw data matrix or data frame containing the variables
to be included in the network. May include missing values. If \code{data} is not
provided (\code{NULL}), a covariance or correlation matrix must be supplied in \code{mat}.}

\item{ns}{Optional numeric sample size specification. Can be a single value
(same sample size is used for all regressions) or a vector (e.g., variable-wise sample
sizes). When \code{data} is provided and \code{ns} is \code{NULL}, sample sizes are derived
automatically from \code{data}. When \code{mat} is supplied instead of raw data,
\code{ns} must be provided and should reflect the sample size underlying \code{mat}.}

\item{mat}{Optional covariance or correlation matrix for the variables to be
included in the network. Used only when \code{data} is \code{NULL}. If both \code{data} and
\code{mat} are supplied, \code{mat} is ignored. When \code{mat} is used, \code{ns} must also be
provided.}

\item{n_calc}{Character string specifying how per-variable sample sizes for
node-wise regression models are computed when \code{ns} is not supplied. If \code{ns}
is provided, its values are used directly and \code{n_calc} is ignored. Possible
values are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"individual"}}{For each variable, uses the number of non-missing
observations for that variable.}
\item{\code{"average"}}{Computes the average number of non-missing observations
across all variables and uses this average as the sample size for every
variable.}
\item{\code{"max"}}{Computes the maximum number of non-missing observations
across all variables and uses this maximum as the sample size for every
variable.}
\item{\code{"total"}}{Uses the total number of rows in \code{data} as the sample size
for every variable.}
}}

\item{k}{Penalty term per parameter (number of predictors + 1) used in the
node-wise regression information criterion. The default \code{k = "log(n)"},
where \code{n} is the number of observations for the dependent variable,
corresponds to the classical BIC. Setting \code{k = "2"} yields the classical AIC.}

\item{ordered}{Logical vector indicating whether each variable in \code{data}
should be treated as ordered categorical. Only used when \code{data} is provided.
If a single logical value is supplied, it is recycled to all variables.}

\item{pcor_merge_rule}{Character string specifying how regression weights
from the node-wise models are merged into partial correlations. Possible
values are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"and"}}{Estimates a partial correlation only if the regression
weights in both directions (e.g., from node 1 to 2 and from node 2 to 1)
are non-zero in the final models.}
\item{\code{"or"}}{Uses the available regression weight from one direction as
the partial correlation if the corresponding regression in the other
direction is not included in the final model.}
}}

\item{missing_handling}{Character string specifying how correlations are
estimated from the \code{data} input in the presence of missing values. Possible
values are:
\describe{
\item{\code{"two-step-em"}}{Uses a classical EM algorithm to estimate the
correlation matrix from \code{data}.}
\item{\code{"stacked-mi"}}{Uses stacked multiple imputation to estimate the
correlation matrix from \code{data}.}
\item{\code{"pairwise"}}{Uses pairwise deletion to compute correlations from
\code{data}.}
\item{\code{"listwise"}}{Uses listwise deletion to compute correlations from
\code{data}.}
}}

\item{nimp}{Number of imputations (default: 20) to be used when
\code{missing_handling = "stacked-mi"}.}

\item{imp_method}{Character string specifying the imputation method to be
used when \code{missing_handling = "stacked-mi"} (default: \code{"pmm"} - predictive
mean matching).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to internal functions.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{pcor}{Partial correlation matrix estimated from the node-wise regressions.}
\item{betas}{Matrix of regression coefficients from the final regression models.}
\item{ns}{Sample sizes used for each variable in the node-wise regressions.}
\item{args}{List of settings used in the network estimation.}
}
}
\description{
Estimates a network structure through node-wise regression models, where each
regression is selected via an information-criterion–based stepwise procedure.
The selected regression coefficients are subsequently combined into partial
correlations to form the final network.
}
\details{
This function estimates a network structure using neighborhood selection guided by information criteria.
Simulations by \insertCite{williams.2019;textual}{mantar} indicated that using the \code{"and"} rule for merging regression weights tends to yield more accurate partial correlation estimates than the \code{"or"} rule.
Both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are supported and have been shown to produce valid network structures.

To handle missing data, the function offers two approaches: a two-step expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and stacked multiple imputation.
According to simulations by \insertCite{nehler.2024;textual}{mantar}, stacked multiple imputation performs reliably across a range of sample sizes.
In contrast, the two-step EM algorithm provides accurate results primarily when the sample size is large relative to the amount of missingness and network complexity - but may still be preferred in such cases due to its much faster runtime.

Currently, the function only supports variables that are directly included in the network analysis; auxiliary variables for missing handling are not yet supported.
During imputation, all variables are imputed by default using predictive mean matching \insertCite{@see e.g., @vanbuuren.2018}{mantar}, with all other variables in the data set serving as predictors.
