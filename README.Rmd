`mantar` provides several methods for estimating psychological networks with and without missing data. For network estimation, two main approaches are implemented:

- Neighborhood selection with information-criteria-based model selection
- Regularized network estimation (e.g., glasso) combined with information criteria

For missing data handling, the preferred two strategies are:

- stacked multiple imputation 
- two-step EM algorithm

The workflow is designed to support typical use cases in psychological research, including varying sample sizes, missingness levels, and variable types.

## Installation

The current stable version (0.2.0) is [available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stuart) and can be installed using the usual approach:

```{r, craninstall, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mantar")
```

You can install the development version of `mantar` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/kai-nehler/mantar). To do so, you need the `remotes` package.

```{r, remotecheck, echo = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
```

```{r, remoteinstall}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kai-nehler/mantar@develop")
```

The suffix `@develop` ensures you install the latest development version with new features and updates.

## Basic Example

`mantar` offers a few dummy data sets for demonstration and testing purposes. Here, we illustrate how to estimate a neighborhood selection network on a continuous data set with missing values using stacked multiple imputation.

```{r, example data prep}
library(mantar)
data(mantar_dummy_mis_cont)
```

Network analysis based on neighborhood selection can be performed using the `neighborhood_net()` function. By default, it uses the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection.

```{r, example network}
result <- neighborhood_net(mantar_dummy_full_cont,
                           missing_handling = "stacked-mi")
summary(result)
result$pcor
```

The summary shows the density of the estimated network and details about the estimation procedure. The partial correlation matrix can be accessed via `result$pcor`.

The package vignette provides:

- network estimation workflows
- missing-data recommendations
- examples for both estimation approaches
