Description: Provides functionality for estimating cross-sectional network structures representing partial correlations in R, while accounting for missing values in the data. Networks are estimated via neighborhood selection, i.e., node-wise multiple regression, with model selection guided by information criteria. Missing data can be handled primarily via multiple imputation or a maximum likelihood-based approach; deletion techniques are available but secondary <doi:10.31234/osf.io/qpj35>.
